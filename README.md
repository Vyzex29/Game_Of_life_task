# Game-of-Life-task

<b>Target:</b> Get practical experience in writing fully functional application following common practices guidelines, SOLID principles and fully follow OOP principles.
<br>
<b>Summary:</b> following several, iterations create “Game of Life” application and provide basis to get required knowledge to participants

<h4>Iteration 1 Requirements</h4>
<ol>

<li>Create Console application – none special UI</li>
<li> Simple navigation menu expected for select size of field</li>
<li>Game field needs to be updated by iteration each second</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h4>Iteration 2 Requirements</h4>
<ol>
<li>Add information to represent count of iteration and count of live cells</li>
<li>Add possibility to save information to file and restore it on application start</li>
<li> Possibility to stop application in any moment</li>
</ol>

<br>

<h4>Iteration 3 Requirements</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Possibility to execute 1000 games in parallel</li>
  <li>Possibility to show selected 8 games on screen</li>
  <li>Possibility to change what exact games will be iterating on screen</li>
  <li>Possibility to same all games at once</li>
